Drug Set Enrichment Analysis (DSEA)
=========================

Drug Set Enrichment Analysis intends to facilitate the assessment of drug responses across multiple cell lines and also allow for drug response prediction.

BASICS:
----

- High-Throughput Drug Testing allows to reveal the impact of a particular drug (set of multiple drugs) on an individual;
- While methodology of the biological experiment quite similar to RNAi or Small Molecules Screening...
- ...its computational side brings new challenges when identifying new drug sets.

HYPOTHESIS:
------------

The most sensitive drugs in any given individual cancer sample tend to show similar response in a cohort of other similar samples.
